Step 1. Run npm install

Step 2. Open two terminal

Step 3. Run npm start in one terminal

Setp 4. Run npm run server in other terminal(For backend json mock server)

Note: I try to deploy this app on the github pages but it is impossible to mock a json server on the github page.

The page is always open but I dout you can try it. Please only run this app in the local following the Steps. Good Luck.
